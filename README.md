# Angular Material Components
========
'angularmaterial' is a Web Components package based on the Angular Material library. The Angular Material project is an implementation of Material Design in Angular.js. This project provides a set of reusable, well-tested, and accessible UI components based on the Material Design system. 


Warning
-------------
The performance of Angular Material library and furthermore of the Angular Material Web Components are not optimal on Windows based browsers (IE, Edge). Is strongly reccomanded to use this set of components only if the browser systems your application should support does not include IE and/or Edge.
Note that using Angular Material Components has perfomance impact also on the HTML5 Servoy Form Editor itself on Windows based systems.

Also note that Material Components are better suited to be used in responsive forms. [Read here](https://github.com/Servoy/angularmaterial/wiki#material-components-and-form-designer).

Getting started
-------------
To add the Angular Material Components in your solution download the angularmaterial.zip from the latest [release](https://github.com/Servoy/angularmaterial/releases) open the Servoy Developer IDE and import the .zip into your workspace; right click on the Web Packages node and import the zip web package.

To use the latest source code clone the git repository and checkout the develop branch. Install the [egit](http://www.eclipse.org/egit/download/) plugin for Eclipse to clone the repository and import the projects into the workspace.

Is suggested to use the Angular Material Components within responsive type of Servoy Form; usage of Material Components in classic anchored type of Servoy Form is allowed but the dimensions (height and width) of the component is not stricly bounded to the design time dimension and may overflow the given size dimensions.
